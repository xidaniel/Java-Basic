## Set
  - HashSet: No guarantees the order of iteration
  - TreeSet: Implemented by BBST
    - There are elements are sorted.
    - TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
    - APIs:
      - floor(E e) Returns the greatest element in this set less than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.
      - ceiling(E e) Returns the least element in this set greater than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.
  - LinkedHashSet: Guarantees the order
  
  
## Map <K,V>
  - HashMap
    - It can only has one null key, it is always mapped to bucket 0.
  - TreeMap
  - LinkedHashMap
